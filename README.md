<h1>openSky Flight Tracker</h1>
This program uses the the openSky API to track flights in real time.</br>
It grabs specific json, and formats the data into geoJSON in order to apply to a Leaflet map.</br>
The program refreshes every 15 seconds, clears the current markers on the map and replaces them the most updated markers.</br>
