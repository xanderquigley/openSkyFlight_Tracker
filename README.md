# openSkyFlight_Tracker
<h2>JavaScript Program using openSky API</h2>
This program uses the the openSky API to track flights in real time.</br>
It grabs specific json, and formats the data into geoJSON in order to apply to a Leaflet map.</br>
The program refreshes every 15 seconds, clears the current markers on the map and replaces them the most updated markers.</br>
<h3>Pain Points</h3>
<p> The biggest pain point in this project was getting the plane icon to display. I was having trouble linking the icon, and found it was a simple typo. Hours spent for a silly mistake.
:)</br>
Another large pain point was figuring out how to clear the map layer of previous flight markers (plane icons) before a new icon was displayed.</br>
To complete this, I watched a few tutorials on youtube with notes on geoJSON and the Leaflet mapping system. </p></br>
<h3>Outcomes Learned</h3>
<p>I found this project to be extremely useful. </br>It utilized: </br>
<ul><li>Leaflet</li>
  <li>JSON and accessing JSON attributes</li>
  <li>API Requests</li>
  <li>Using popups within the HTML to display information</li>
</ul>
